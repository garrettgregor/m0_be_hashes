# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
  - I was really happy that a lot of this lesson seemed to flow pretty naturally, but remembering the exact syntax was hard at first. I couldn't remember when to use `,` and when to use `[] or {}`
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
  - I find myself taking notes with [iDoRecall](idorecall.com) and found it helpful for the evaluation so that I could quickly go back over the terminology in Mod 0. I need to go back and include the terminology that I missed.
  - I haven't found myself using [Notion](notion.com) though and would like to get in a better workflow of using it or commit to using pen and paper (I can't wait for my new pens and notebooks to get here to test out my new indexing technique)
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
  - I leaned into googling first but wasn't shy to just try. For example, when using the `timestamp:` key-value I initially googled to get a general idea for how to use `Date` and `Time`, but didn't dive too deep and tried to use it on my own after the first exercise.
  - I also find myself going back to the lessons for guidance.
